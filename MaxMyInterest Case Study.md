## Overview and Origin
MaxMyInterest was launched at April 2014, by Six Trees Capital. Six Trees Capital LL was founded in 2013. The company, Six Trees Capital and MaxMyInterest, were both founded by Gary E. Zimmerman. Additionally, Six Trees Capital has a Board of Advisors from areas of Law, Cybersecurity, Data Privacy, and Finance.

After the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), many large financial institutions reduced the interest rates paid on the deposits held in checking and savings accounts to near zero as a result of the Fed funds rate being at the lower bound. The service was developed, partially, as a solution to this low rate problem — providing savers the opportunity to earn higher rates than they would have otherwise made with their primary financial institution. Another issue that this service solve is the $250,000 FDIC Insurance limit. While this may not be a problem for most savers, many HNW individuals sold significant amounts of cash above the FDIC limit. With MaxMyInterest, individuals can get up to $4 million in FDIC insurance managed and allocated automatically.

The company participated in an accelerator program run by the Partnership Fund for New York City and Accenture called the FinTech Innovation Lab in 2015. Still, it is unclear if they received funding from this program. Later that year in December, they won the UBS Future of Finance Challenge, which came with a $50k cash prize. According to Crunchbase, MaxMyInterest received an investment from Growth-Equity firm Chasella, for an undisclosed amount. The investor list from Pitchbook lists three outside investors: ThirdStream Partners, FinTech Innovation Lab, and Chasella.
## Business Activities
As mention above, the company provides two solutions for savers. One, it helps them earn higher savings rates than they would be able to make in their traditional checking or savings accounts. And two, it optimizes the saving process for those who have more than $250,000 in savings by distributing the money above that amount to other higher-yielding accounts, while making sure each account remains under the FDIC insured limit.

The company has a broad market — anyone that is looking to earn more interest on their savings. This can be an individual or a business. Using the simple heuristic of the 18-and-over population in the United States, MaxMyInterest potentially has over 200 million potential customers. Realistically, the market is not that large as American’s pay little attention to the interest rates their banks pay them, and many would not feel incentivized enough to try to maximize their interest on small dollar amounts. MaxMyInterest’s service skews towards the affluent as having excess savings, and being concerned about the interest rate on the cash is not a problem of the majority. MaxMyInterest’s service is compelling because it “solves for” the restrictions of FDIC insurance during a low rate environment. Traditionally, banking consumers are “sticky,” allowing banks to pay meager interest rates without any concern that consumers would switch to a bank that pays a higher interest rate. They serve as the conduit by removing the inertia of setting up and maintaining multiple accounts. Enabling consumers to do it through a single platform.

Max uses a combination of traditional financial technologies in addition to new applications and data technologies. Stackshare lists jQuery, Modernizr, Backbone.js, and Raspbian as application and data for MaxMyInterest. The software for their service is most likely based on a simple optimization model of if/elif/else statements to get the consumer the maximum interest rate while staying under the FDIC limit. In that way, the software is probably most similar to that of a robocalls-advisor. Ironically, the mechanics of moving money from one account to another are done bank-to-bank through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) Network.

## Landscape
Max crosses multiple domains in the financial industry, but it is most commonly associated with Personal Finance. Partnerships with Schwab and Dynasty Financial also make Max an innovator in the Wealth Management space, delivered through a platform that is Robo-Advisor-like.

The areas of Personal Finance, Wealth Management, and Robo-Advisors have all developed and evolved dramatically over the past 5-10 years as the Great Financial Crisis spurred many changes in the way Finance interacts with Technology. The primary domain of Personal Finance has evolved most dramatically during this period as it has become personal, where the consumer can execute exact control over their finances through a mobile application or a webpage.

MaxMyInterest is still a relative niche company within personal finance technologies more broadly, and as such, there are not “major companies” in this domain that are competing with them.

## Results

The impact of Max has not been revolutionary or disruptive, like other FinTech companies, like Robinhood, for example. It would be more accurate to save Max has been successful in augmenting the infrastructure of the traditional banking system for the benefit of the end-consumer.

A key metric that Robo-Advisory platforms use to measure the success of their offering is Assets Under Management (AUM). For Max, an equivalent metric would be the amount of assets allocated by the platform. Another key metric for performance would be the amount of interest above the benchmark rate the service is earning for consumers. In the Investment Management industry, commonly referred to as alpha. As a private company they are not obligated to publish the amount of money currently on their platform. They do publish their maximum yield, which is 161 basis points higher than the national average.

## Recommendation
The attractiveness of Max is partially in the simplicity of the service that it provides. They have been measured in their expansion of products, only launching a checking account service in September 2019. Their best path forward is finding proactive ways to distribute the product to a broader audience. To do so, they would also need to develop the sophistication and compatibility of their Technology. Currently, they are integrated with Schwab’s One Source platform — used by Schwab’s institutional clients. Unfortunately, the ability for advisory firms to capitalize on Max’s offering is limited, as the integration between Max’s platform and the billing practices of advisory firms is anything but seamless (which I know from experience as we looked into the service at the firm I work for). For Max to “take-off” and reach the mass-affluent. The service would have become better integrated into custodial platforms, of not only Schwab but also, Fidelity and Pershing. In addition to all of the large wirehouse firms, including Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, UBS, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and LPL, to name a few. The challenge with the latter is that many wirehouse firms cross-sell products, and they do not have an incentive to have money held outside of their platforms. The problem with custodians is differing technology platforms that Max may not have the capability to scale at this time.

## Concluding Thoughts
It is somewhat ironic that MaxMyInterest was founded six years ago, as a response to the financial environment of a post-Great Financial Crisis world because six years later, we are dealing with a different crisis but with similar financial results. Many are forecasting and the Federal Reserve has confirmed just this week, that low rates are here to stay. And as a result, MaxMyInterest long-term prospects for continued growth and consumer acquisition are promising as consumers desire for yield will only increase.
